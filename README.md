# Crux

Crux parses Web pages to identify the crux of an article — the very essential points — minus all the fluff.

## Features

- Rich formatted content available, not just plain text.
- Support for more sites & better parsing overall.
- Support for more metadata formats: OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, Schema.org.
- Small footprint and code size: JSoup is the only required dependency.
- Fewer setters/getters, to keep the method count low (this is important for Android).
- The ability to use HTTP libraries besides the default HttpUrlConnection, such as OkHttp, under the hood.
- Cleaner, leaner code (compared to other libraries not optimized for Android)
- First-class support for importing into Android Studio projects via Gradle.
- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chimbori/crux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chimbori/crux) Continuous integration with unit tests and golden file tests.  

# Usage
 
## Import via Gradle

Project/`build.gradle`:
```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```

Module/`build.gradle`:
```
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.chimbori:crux:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## Sample Code

> Note that the Crux API is not yet final (we do not have a 1.0 release candidate yet), and it is likely to change. Feel free to use in your own projects, and let us know if the current API can be improved upon. And be prepared to update your apps if you update to a newer version of Crux that changes the API. Once we hit 1.0, we will be keeping the API fairly constant, so you would not need to keep updating your apps.

Using a singleton instance of OkHttp.
```java
OkHttpClient okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient();
```

In a background thread:
```java
CandidateURL candidateUrl = new CandidateURL(url); 
if (candidateURL.isLikelyArticle()) {
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url(url)  // Customize your network request as you see fit.
      .build();
  Response response = okHttpClient.newCall().execute();
  Article article = new Extractor().extractContent(response.body().string());
}
```

On the UI thread:
```java
// Use article.document, article.title, etc.
```

# History

Crux began as a fork of [Snacktory](http://github.com/karussell/snacktory) with the goal of making it more performant on Android devices, 
but it has quickly gained several new features that are not available in Snacktory.   

Snacktory (and thus Crux) borrow ideas and test cases from [Goose](https://github.com/GravityLabs/goose) 
and [JReadability](https://github.com/ifesdjeen/jReadability).
