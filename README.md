# Snacktroid

Snacktroid is a fork of [Snacktory](http://github.com/karussell/snacktory) specially built for Android devices, but by no means exclusive to Android.

Snacktory is a library that can extract text, keywords, main image, and other metadata from a Web article.

Snacktory (and thus Snacktroid) borrow ideas and test cases from [Goose](https://github.com/GravityLabs/goose) 
and [JReadability](https://github.com/ifesdjeen/jReadability).

## Goals

Snacktroid is a work in progress. Not all goals have been met yet, but hereâ€™s a list of what we want to achieve with Snacktroid.

- Fewer dependencies: JSoup is the only required dependency.
- Fewer setters/getters, to keep the method count low.
- The ability to use HTTP libraries besides the default HttpUrlConnection, such as OkHttp, under the hood.
- First-class support for importing via Gradle.
- Cleaner code, e.g. throwing specific Exceptions instead of `java.lang.Exception` and better error handling.

# Features

  - article text detection 
  - get top image url(s)
  - get top video url
  - extraction of description, keywords, ...
  - good detection for none-english sites (German, Japanese, ...), snacktory does not depend on the word count in its text detection to support CJK languages 
  - good charset detection
  - possible to do URL resolving, but caching is still possible after resolving
  - skipping some known filetypes
  - no http GET required to run the core tests

## TODO

 * Only top text is currently supported.

# Usage
 
## Import via Gradle

Project/`build.gradle`:
```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```

Module/`build.gradle`:
```
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.chimbori:snacktroid:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## Sample Code

Using a singleton instance of OkHttp.
```java
OkHttpClient okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient();
```

In a background thread:
```java
CandidateURL candidateUrl = new CandidateURL(url); 
if (candidateURL.isLikelyArticle()) {
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url(url)  // Customize your network request as you see fit.
      .build();
  Response response = okHttpClient.newCall().execute();
  ParsedResult result = new Extractor().extractContent(response.body().toString());
}
```

On the UI thread:
```java
// Use result.text, result.title, etc.
```
